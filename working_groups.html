                        <p>Computer software allows researchers to find patterns and analyze extremely large datasets.
                            Many premeds learn data science and apply it to their projects. Additionally, premeds can
                            learn to program in coding languages like Python and R, which are particularly useful for
                            research. </p>
                        <p>Computational modeling in health care can be used to create simulations of complex biological
                            mechanisms and predict outcomes. Popular computational modeling applications in medicine for
                            premeds include tracking infectious diseases, predicting drug side effects and calculating
                            the effects of public health interventions. Most recently, computational models have been
                            applied to COVID-19 outbreak predictions.</p>

                        <p>A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous car, driver-less car, or robotic car
                            (robo-car), is a car incorporating vehicular automation, that is, a ground vehicle that is
                            capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.
                            Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as
                            thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.
                            Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation
                            paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. Control methods based on artificial
                            intelligence can then be used to learn all the gathered sensory information in order to
                            control the vehicle and support various autonomous-driving tasks. As a future technology,
                            they are predicted to have a comprehensive impact on automobile industry, health, welfare,
                            urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market and other fields.</p>

                        <p>Blockchain is a method of recording information that makes it impossible or difficult for the
                            system to be changed, hacked, or manipulated. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that
                            duplicates and distributes transactions across the network of computers participating in the
                            blockchain.Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also
                            known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network
                            connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a ‘digital

                        <p>Although fifth-generation (5G) networks are still in the deployment phase, researchers are
                            already investigating the upcoming sixth generation (6G). It is generally agreed that the
                            requirements of future wireless networks will be primarily determined by the applications
                            they will have to support. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct thorough research and
                            analysis on the most suitable technologies to ensure the key requirements of 6G networks are
                            met and to understand what the characteristics of 6G should be to provide more benefits
                            compared to previous generations.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the potential use cases of 6G networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) has recently
                            gained widespread attention and is set to take a leading role in the future. Currently,
                            smart devices that exploit connectivity offered by mobile wireless networks are deployed
                            everywhere and impact the most various of contexts, which enables the IoT to new concepts
                            such as the Internet of Everything (IoE), the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), and the
                            Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) to evolve.</p>

                        <p>An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human
                            pilot, crew, or passengers on board. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft
                            system(UAS). which includes adding a ground-based controller and a system of communications
                            with the UAV. The flight of UAVs may operate under remote control by a human operator, as
                            remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA), or with various degrees of autonomy, such as autopilot
                            assistance, up to fully autonomous aircraft that have no provision for human intervention.
