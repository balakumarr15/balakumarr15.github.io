                The Next Generation Networks Laboratory (NGNLab) in the Department of Computer Technology, Anna
                University, MIT Campus, was established in 2012 with the Department of Science and Technology (DST)
                sponsor. The lab's principal investigator is Dr. Gunasekaran Raja, a Professor in the Department of
                Computer Technology, Anna University. He is a Postdoctoral Fellow from the University of California,
                Davis, USA. The NGNLab has over 100 publications in high-impact factor journals such as IEEE
                Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Vehicular Technology, Internet of Things, Industrial
                Informatics, etc., and conference articles in venues such as IEEE: INFOCOM, GLOBECOM, ICC, VTC, ACM:
                MobiCom, etc. In the lab, currently, 7 Ph.D. scholars are pursuing, currently investigating domains
                related to ground and autonomous aerial vehicles, with specialized focus on networking via 5G, 6G,
                vision-based approaches, and security protocols. Now, the team is involved in designing a novel
                Blockchain-enabled Supply Chain Management system in collaboration with the University of Dublin,
                Ireland. The lab makes ground-breaking contributions in cutting-edge domains such as artificial
                intelligence, cyber security, and blockchain technology to revolutionize mobile networking
                internationally. Other notable contributions to international research include intelligent hand-off
                optimization, adaptive network traffic management, a hybridized deep reinforcement learning approach to
                vehicle platooning, and an intelligent lane-changing mechanism for dynamic VANETs. Owing to the diverse
                and novel research, NGNLab has been sanctioned grants for noteworthy projects such as the development of
                an automatic steering control system in manually operated tractors, a programmable remote monitoring
                system, a smart classroom, an examination system, as well as a traffic management mechanism for public
                safety. All such undertakings of NGNLab are closely collaborating with researchers from within India and
                across top-tier universities in the USA, Germany, UK, Qatar, Ireland, and more. The NGNLab provides
                international exposure via collaborative research with top researchers worldwide and student exchange
                with international collaborators at the University of California, Davis, USA, Trinity College, Dublin,
                Ireland (under Erasmus+ Credit Mobile) etc. Numerous internship opportunities in fortune 500 companies
                like SAP, Amazon, etc., are also supported network of alumni in companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google,
                etc.
